# Thulium (Tm) Templating #

A proper templating engine. With specs and a syntax that isn't crazy (ie. Not
Jade and not EJS).


## Usage ##

Right now it's in heavy testing/dev mode. Not reallk "a thing". But this
will make your life easier:

```
$ npm install
$ npm link
$ npm link thulium
$ node etc/test.js
```

You'll be in a console with thulium already loaded. Yay!
